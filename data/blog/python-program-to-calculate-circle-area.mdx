# Python Program to Calculate Circle Area

```python
# 3. Write a Python program which accepts the radius of a circle from the user and compute the area. (area = pi * r^2)
from math import pi

r = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))
area = str(pi * r**2)
print("The area of the circle with radius " + str(r) + " is " + area)
```

## Explanation:

1. The program starts by importing the `pi` constant from the `math` module.
2. It then prompts the user to enter the radius of the circle using the `input` function and converts the input to a float using `float()`.
3. The area of the circle is calculated using the formula `area = pi * r^2`, where `r` is the radius entered by the user.
4. The calculated area is converted to a string using `str()` and concatenated with a message string.
5. Finally, the message string containing the radius and calculated area is printed to the console.

## Usage:

When you run this program, it will prompt you to enter the radius of the circle. For example:

```
Enter the radius of the circle: 5
```

After entering the radius, the program will output the calculated area:

```
The area of the circle with radius 5.0 is 78.53981633974483
```
