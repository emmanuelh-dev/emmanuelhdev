# How to Create a New File in GitHub Using a Customized URL

GitHub is a popular platform for version control and collaborative software development. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, knowing how to create a new file in a GitHub repository can be incredibly helpful. In this blog post, we'll walk through the steps to create a new file using a customized URL.

## Step 1: Compose the URL

To create a new file, start with the base URL:

```markdown
https://github.com/username/project_name/new/branch_name/
```

Replace the placeholders with the relevant information:

- `username`: Your GitHub username.
- `project_name`: The name of your project/repository.
- `branch_name`: The branch where you want to create the file (e.g., `master`).


## Step 2: Add content to URL

Next, add the desired **file path after the branch name to specify where you want to create the file**. For example, if you want to create a file in a specific folder, specify the folder path.

### Add a file name

To specify the name of the new file, append `?filename=your_file_name` to the end of the URL. Replace `your_file_name` with the desired filename (e.g., `test.mdx`).

### Add content

Optionally, if you want to add content to the new file immediately, include `&value=your_content` in the URL.

Let's say you're working on the `emmanuelhdev` project, and you want to create a new markdown entry file named `test.mdx` in the `tests` folder under the `master` branch. Here's the customized URL:

```markdown
https://blog.bysmax.com/blog/generador-de-cabeceras-para-tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog

```

As an example, I developed [this tool](https://blog.bysmax.com/blog/generador-de-cabeceras-para-tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog). Simply enter the title and body, and begin typing your new entry.
